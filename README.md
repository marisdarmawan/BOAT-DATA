# BOAT-DATA
You are working as a data analyst for a yacht and boat sales website. The marketing team is
preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get
more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.
They would like you to take a look at the recent data and help them learn more about the
characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7 days - is it the most expensive boats
that get the most views? Are there common features among the most viewed boats?
Your presentation should be no longer than ten minutes. It should include no more than eight
slides of content. You will be presenting to the Head of Marketing.
